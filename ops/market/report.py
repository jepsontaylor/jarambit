## Market weight comparison

The source-audited [October 13, 2026 census](docs/market/2026-10-13/README.md) consolidates eight supplied CSVs plus an additional qualifying polymer model. **{s['qualified_entries']} identifiable entries meet the published 3.375 in blade minimum; {s['plotted_entries']} have comparable verified published knife weights.** Color-only duplicates are consolidated; genuine material variants and distinct custom examples remain separate. Missing weights and unresolved candidates stay visible in the evidence tables.

![Karambit market weight and blade-length comparison](docs/market/2026-10-13/figures/market_landscape.png)

**SWITCHBACK C.10a RC4: {bm:.3f} g, CAD prediction.** Nominally lighter than {s['benchmark_lighter_than_count']} of {s['plotted_entries']} plotted entries ({s['benchmark_lighter_than_fraction']:.1%}); {s['benchmark_below_median_fraction']:.1%} below their {s['market_median_g']:.2f} g median. TALIM titanium lists 51.03 g, so this does not support a lightest-overall claim. C.10a is a release candidate, unmanufactured and untested; `g3_tip+00_t60_tt3` remains the historical 84.80 g design of record. Listed commercial lengths use different measurement conventions, and material/weight comparisons establish no performance equivalence.
